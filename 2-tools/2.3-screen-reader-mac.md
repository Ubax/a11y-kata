## Exercises

### Exercise 1 - Turning on and off

Turn the screen reader on and off, to get familiar with the process. To that press `âŒ˜ + F5`.

### Exercise 2 - Basic navigation

1. Go to a wikipedia page, for example https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salzburg.
2. Turn on the screen reader (`âŒ˜ + F5`).
3. Follow the screen reader instructions to enter web content (`Ctrl + Option + Shift + Down Arrow`).
4. Move around the website using `Ctrl + Option + Right/Left Arrow`.

| Mac | Turn screen reader off | `âŒ˜ + F5` |

### Exercise 3 - Headings

The navigation through every element in the website is time consuming. Most of the screen reader users are navigating the page via headers.

1. Come back to the wikipedia page
2. Navigate using `Ctrl + Option + Cmd + H` and `Ctrl + Option + Cmd + Shift + H` shortcuts.

> ðŸ’¡ Hint:
> You can use `Ctrl + Option + ;` to lock the voice over shortcut on and off. Then you don't need to press `Ctrl + Option` every time.
> In many shortcuts `Ctrl + Option` is written as `VO`.

| OS  | Action          | Shortcut                          |
| --- | --------------- | --------------------------------- |

| Mac | Move in rotor list | `Up/down arrow`     |

### Exercise 6 - Automatic reading

When you find a place on the website that you want to listen more to, you don't need to use arrow keys to navigate through the content. You can use automatic reading.

| --- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Mac | Open settings         | `Ctrl + Option + any arrow`                |
