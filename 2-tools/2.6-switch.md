# 2.6. Switch Control - Work in Progress

**Note: Currently, the exercises are only available for Mac.**

This section offers a brief introduction to switch control. For more detailed information, refer to the resources at the end.

## What is Switch Control?

Switch control is an accessibility feature that allows individuals with limited mobility to interact with their devices using alternative input methods. Instead of relying on traditional touch or keyboard inputs, users can operate the device through [adaptive switches](https://enablingdevices.com/blog/different-types-of-adaptive-switches-for-individuals-with-disabilities/), which can be triggered by actions such as pressing, sipping, or puffing. Common types of switch control include:
- **Single-switch scanning**: A single switch cycles through on-screen options, and the user activates their choice.
- **Multi-switch systems**: Each switch is assigned to a specific action, such as clicking or selecting.

## Prerequisites

Mac devices come with built-in switch control software. To complete these exercises, you need to activate it.
