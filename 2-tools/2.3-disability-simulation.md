# 2.3 Disability Simulators

## Prerequisites

These exercises were tested on two browsers: Chrome and Firefox. While most exercises can be completed using built-in tools or free websites, some require additional software.

- **Chrome**: Two tested alternatives:
  - Free: [Web Disability Simulator](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/web-disability-simulator/olioanlbgbpmdlgjnnampnnlohigkjla)
  - Free, but requires login: [Stark Accessibility Checker](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/stark-accessibility-check/fkfaapnmfippddbeemjjbclenphooipm)
- **Firefox**: Two tested alternatives:
  - Free (built-in): `Accessibility` tab in Developer Tools (only for color simulations)
  - Free, but requires login: [Stark Accessibility Checker](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stark-accessibility-checker/)

## Exercises

Please note: The tools in these exercises simulate disabilities and may not fully reflect the actual experience of users with these conditions.

### Exercise 1: Simulating Color Blindness

In this exercise, you will experience different types of [color blindness](https://www.nei.nih.gov/learn-about-eye-health/eye-conditions-and-diseases/color-blindness/types-color-vision-deficiency).

1. Go to [Google Doodles](https://doodles.google/).
2. Turn on the color blindness simulator:

- **Chrome**:
  - `Web Disability Simulator`: select a vision simulator such as _Total color blindness_, _Yellow-Blue color blindness_, or _Red-Green color blindness_.
  - `Stark Accessibility Checker`: choose one of the `Color blind` options under `Vision Simulator`.
  
- **Firefox**:
  - Open developer tools (<kbd>⌥+⌘+I</kbd>), go to the `Accessibility` tab, and select a simulation option from the `Simulate` dropdown.
  - Or use `Stark Accessibility Checker` and select one of the `Color blind` options.

- **Other browsers**:
  - Use online tools like [Toptal Color Filter](https://www.toptal.com/designers/colorfilter/) or [Coblis](https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/).

### Exercise 2: Simulating Low Vision

In this exercise, you will simulate low vision.

1. Go to any website, such as [Google Doodles](https://doodles.google/).
2. Enable a low vision simulation:

- **Chrome**:
  - `Web Disability Simulator`: select the `Far sightedness` option.
  - `Stark Accessibility Checker`: select the `Blurred` option from `Vision Simulator`.
  
- **Firefox**:
  - `Stark Accessibility Checker`: select the `Blurred` option from `Vision Simulator`.

### Exercise 3: Simulating Tunnel Vision

Tunnel vision (peripheral vision loss) restricts vision to only what is directly in front of the person. In this exercise, you’ll simulate this condition.

1. Go to any website, such as [Google Doodles](https://doodles.google/).
2. Enable tunnel vision simulation:

- **Chrome**:
  - `Web Disability Simulator`: select the `Tunnel vision` option.
  - `Stark Accessibility Checker`: choose the `Tunnel vision` option from `Vision Simulator`.
  
- **Firefox**:
  - `Stark Accessibility Checker`: select the `Tunnel vision` option from `Vision Simulator`.
