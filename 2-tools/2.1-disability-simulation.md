# 2.1. Disability simulators

## Prerequisites

This kata was tested on two browsers: Chrome and Firefox. Most of the exercises can be done using the built-in tools or free websites, however some of them require additional software.

- Chrome - there are two alternatives tested for this kata:
  - Free - [Web Disability Simulator](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/web-disability-simulator/olioanlbgbpmdlgjnnampnnlohigkjla)
  - Free, but requires logging in - [Stark Accessibility checker](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/stark-accessibility-check/fkfaapnmfippddbeemjjbclenphooipm)
- Firefox - there are two alternatives tested for this kata:
  - Free and built in - `Accessibility` tab in developer tools (works only for color simulations)
  - Free, but requires logging in - [Stark Accessibility checker](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stark-accessibility-checker/)

## Exercises

Remember that tools used in the following exercises are only simulators and they may not reflect the real experience of people with disabilities.

### Exercise 1 - Color blindness

In this exercise you will simulate color blindness. There are multiple [types of color blindness](https://www.nei.nih.gov/learn-about-eye-health/eye-conditions-and-diseases/color-blindness/types-color-vision-deficiency). In this exercise you will experience some of them.

Go to any website, for example [Google doodles](https://doodles.google/), and turn on the color blindness simulator. You can do it in multiple ways:

- Chrome:
  - `Web Disability Simulator`, select one of the options from sight simulators (_Total color blindness_, _Yellow-Blue color blindness_, _Red-Green color blindness_).
  - `Stark Accessibility checker`, select the one of the `Color blind` options from `Vision Simulator`.
- Firefox:
  - open developer tools (`⌥+⌘+I`) and go to `Accessibility` tab. Select any option from the `Simulate` select.
  - `Stark Accessibility checker`, select the one of the `Color blind` options from `Vision Simulator`.
- Other browsers:
  - you can use online tools like [Toptal color filter](https://www.toptal.com/designers/colorfilter/) or [Coblis](https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/)

### Exercise 2 - Low vision

In this exercise you will simulate low vision. Go to any website, for example [Google doodles](https://doodles.google/), and turn on the low vision simulator. You can do it in multiple ways:
