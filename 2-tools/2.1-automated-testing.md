# 2.1. Automated Accessibility Testing Tools

In this section, you'll learn to use tools that run automated accessibility tests on your website. Keep in mind that **automated tools alone cannot guarantee full WCAG compliance**. They provide a strong starting point, but manual checks are always necessary.

## Prerequisites

You'll need to install the following tool: **WAVE**.

- [Chrome Add-on](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wave-evaluation-tool/jbbplnpkjmmeebjpijfedlgcdilocofh)
- [Firefox Add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/wave-accessibility-tool/)

You will also use built-in tools available in Chrome or Firefox:

- **Chrome**
  - Lighthouse: Open Dev Tools (<kbd>⌥+⌘+I</kbd>) -> `Lighthouse` tab.
- **Firefox**
  - Accessibility Dev Tools: Open Dev Tools (<kbd>⌥+⌘+I</kbd>) -> `Accessibility` tab -> `Check for issues`.

## Exercises

> **Note:** You only need to complete **either** Exercise 1 or 2. Afterwards, proceed to Exercise 3.

### Exercise 1: Lighthouse (Chrome)

1. Open any website.
2. Open Dev Tools (<kbd>⌥+⌘+I</kbd>).
3. Go to the `Lighthouse` tab (you may find it under `>>` if not visible).
4. Select `Navigation (Default)` mode, choose a device preset, and check `Accessibility`.
5. Click `Analyze page load`.

Lighthouse will generate a report with an accessibility score, list of issues, and suggestions. Expand any issue to see details, including the affected DOM elements. You can export the report as JSON or PDF by clicking the `⋮` menu.

### Exercise 2: Firefox Accessibility Dev Tools

1. Open any website.
2. Open Dev Tools (<kbd>⌥+⌘+I</kbd>).
3. Go to the `Accessibility` tab (you may find it under `>>` if not visible).
4. Click `Check for issues` and select `All issues`.

The tool will provide a report with accessibility issues. Expand any issue to view details and affected DOM elements.

### Exercise 3: WAVE

1. Open any website.
2. Click the WAVE icon in your browser toolbar, or right-click and select `WAVE this page`.
3. WAVE will display a report, highlighting accessibility issues directly on the webpage.
4. In the `Details` tab, deselect all except `Errors` and `Alerts` to focus on critical issues.

More WAVE features will be explored in [3.2. Manual Testing](3.2-manual-testing.md).
