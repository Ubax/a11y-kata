        <h2>1. The Dawn of the Personal Computer</h2>
        <p>
          The personal computer (PC) revolution began in the mid-1970s, with
          early pioneers like the Altair 8800 and the Apple I. While these
          machines were primarily aimed at hobbyists and tech enthusiasts, they
          marked the beginning of a technological shift that would soon reach
          millions of homes.

        <p>
          In 1977, the launch of the Apple II and the Commodore PET helped
          popularize the idea of personal computing. These early PCs introduced
          many households to the concept of having their own programmable
          device, rather than relying on mainframe or shared computers.
        </p>

        <h2>2. The Rise of the IBM PC and Competition</h2>
        <p>
          The true turning point came in 1981 when IBM introduced its first
          personal computer, the IBM PC. Powered by an Intel 8088 processor and
          running Microsoft’s MS-DOS operating system, the IBM PC became a
          standard for the rapidly growing market.

        <p>
          Competitors like Apple, Atari, and Commodore developed their own
          systems, driving innovation. This period saw a surge in accessibility,
          with prices dropping and software like word processors, spreadsheets,
          and games making the PC essential for both work and entertainment.
        </p>

        <h2>3. PCs Enter the Mainstream</h2>
        <p>
          By the late 1980s and early 1990s, personal computers were becoming
          increasingly common in households around the world. Advancements in
          user-friendly graphical interfaces, like Microsoft Windows and Apple’s
          Mac OS, made PCs more accessible to non-technical users.
        </p>

        <p>
          The launch of the Macintosh in 1984, with its iconic graphical
          interface and mouse, changed how people interacted with computers. It
          paved the way for everyday users to perform tasks like word
          processing, desktop publishing, and basic programming from the comfort
          of their own homes.
        </p>

        <h2>4. The Digital Home Office and Gaming Revolution</h2>
        <p>
          As PCs became more powerful and affordable, their uses expanded beyond
          just work-related tasks. The rise of the Internet in the 1990s allowed
          households to connect with the world like never before. At the same
          time, the gaming industry exploded, with PCs serving as platforms for
          iconic games like "Doom," "SimCity," and "Myst."

        <p>
          The ability to run businesses, study, and play games from a home
          computer turned the PC into a central hub of daily life. During this
          period, the personal computer evolved into a staple of modern
          households, forever changing how we work, learn, and socialize.
        </p>

        <h2>5. The PC in the Modern Household</h2>
        <p>
          Today, personal computers have transformed into laptops, desktops,
          tablets, and even smartphones, seamlessly integrated into our daily
          routines. Whether used for work, entertainment, or connecting with
          others, PCs have revolutionized the way we live, making digital
          technology an indispensable part of every home.

          As we look forward, the PC continues to evolve, adapting to new
          technologies like cloud computing, AI, and virtual reality, ensuring
