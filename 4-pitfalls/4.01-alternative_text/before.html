        <h2>1. The Early Writing Machines</h2>
        <p>
          The journey of the keyboard begins with the invention of the
          typewriter in the 19th century. Typewriters allowed for mechanized
          writing, speeding up document creation and standardizing written
          communication.

          alt="The image shows an old mechanical typewriter that has a charming, vintage look. At the top, a piece of paper is coming out of the machine, suggesting that something is being typed. Below, there are several levers that look worn and old-fashioned. The round keys have letters on them, making it easy to imagine the words that were once typed. This typewriter is a beautiful reminder of the past and how people used to write."

        <p>
          The first commercial typewriter was introduced in 1874 by Christopher
          Sholes. It used a layout we now call QWERTY, designed to prevent
          jamming by spacing out frequently used letters.
        </p>

        <h2>2. The Transition to Electric Keyboards</h2>
        <p>
          In the mid-20th century, electric typewriters started to gain
          popularity, offering faster typing and improved accuracy. These
          machines paved the way for computer keyboards as we know them today.

        <p>
          Electric typewriters used fewer mechanical parts, replacing the
          typebars with electric circuitry. IBM's Selectric typewriter was a
          revolutionary design, featuring a 'golf ball' head to print letters.
        </p>

        <h2>3. The Arrival of the Computer Keyboard</h2>
        <p>
          With the rise of personal computers in the late 20th century, the
          keyboard evolved to serve a new purpose. The first computer keyboards
          were based on teletype machines, but quickly adapted for modern
          computing needs.

        <p>
          The layout largely remained the same as the typewriter’s QWERTY
          design, but additional keys like function keys, escape, and control
          were added for greater utility.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Modern Ergonomic Keyboards</h2>
        <p>
          In the 21st century, the need for comfortable and health-conscious
          keyboards led to the creation of ergonomic designs. These keyboards
          aim to reduce strain on the hands and wrists for long-term use.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ergonomic keyboards feature a split layout, contoured shapes, and
          other innovations to promote a more natural typing position.
