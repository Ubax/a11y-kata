        <h2>1. The Birth of the Internet</h2>
        <p>
          The story of the Internet begins in the 1960s, when ARPANET was
          developed by the U.S. Department of Defense to create a communication
          network capable of withstanding a nuclear attack. This early
          experiment in packet switching laid the groundwork for what would
          later become the Internet.

        <p>
          ARPANET’s decentralized design allowed data to be routed through
          multiple paths, ensuring that communication could continue even if
          parts of the network were compromised.
        </p>

        <h2>2. The Expansion of Global Connectivity</h2>
        <p>
          Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, new technologies like TCP/IP emerged,
          enabling different networks to connect with each other. By the early
          1990s, the Internet as we know it today began to take shape with the
          invention of the World Wide Web by Tim Berners-Lee. This innovation
          transformed the Internet from a niche research tool into a platform
          accessible to the general public.

        <p>
          The introduction of graphical web browsers like Mosaic in 1993 allowed
          users to navigate websites easily, sparking a global revolution in how
          information was accessed and shared.
        </p>

        <h2>3. The Digital Revolution</h2>
        <p>
          The Internet's rapid growth in the 1990s and early 2000s led to a
          transformation of nearly every aspect of modern life. Email,
          e-commerce, social media, and search engines all became part of the
          digital ecosystem, changing how we communicate, shop, work, and
          entertain ourselves.

        <p>
          This period marked the rise of tech giants like Google, Amazon, and
          Facebook, companies that harnessed the power of the Internet to
          reshape industries and economies.
        </p>

        <h2>4. The Internet Today and Beyond</h2>
        <p>
          Today, the Internet has evolved into an essential part of daily life
          for billions of people. With advancements in mobile technology,
          artificial intelligence, and cloud computing, the Internet continues
          to drive innovation. The rise of social networks, streaming services,
          and the Internet of Things (IoT) has led to an interconnected world
          where nearly everything is accessible online.

        <p>
          Looking ahead, the Internet is expected to play a pivotal role in the
          development of emerging technologies like 5G, virtual reality, and
          blockchain, further transforming industries and societies.
