## Problems & solutions

<details>
<summary>Problem 1</summary>

Focusable elements donâ€™t have an outline or a visual indicator when they receive focus. This makes it hard for keyboard users to know where they are on the page. [WCAG 2.4.7 Focus Visible](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/focus-visible)

</details>
<details>
<summary>Solution for problem 1</summary>

Remove `outline: none;` from the `<style>` block to ensure focus is visibly highlighted.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Problem 2</summary>

CSS is altering the visual order, but the focus follows the DOM structure, causing confusion for keyboard users. [WCAG 2.4.3 Focus Order](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/focus-order.html)

</details>
<details>
<summary>Solution for problem 2</summary>

Remove the `order` property from the CSS to ensure the visual and focus order align. Learn more on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flexible_box_layout/Ordering_flex_items#the_order_property_and_accessibility).

</details>

<details>
<summary>Problem 3</summary>

When the side menu is hidden, focus can still navigate to it because it remains in the DOM.

</details>
<details>
<summary>Solution for problem 3</summary>

Two possible solutions:

1. Using the [`inert`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/inert) attribute
   ```js
   hamburger.addEventListener("click", () => {
       ...
       sideMenu.inert = !sideMenu.classList.contains("active");
   });
   ```
2. Use `display: none` instead of moving the menu off-screen with `left: -...`. Note that this will disable the animation.
   ```css
   .side-menu {
       ...
       display: none;
   }
   .side-menu.active {
       display: block;
   }
   ```
