# 3.1. Automated accessibility testing

In this part of the kata you will learn how to use tools that help you run automated accessibility tests on your website. Remember, that using automated tools **does not guarantee full WACG compliance**. It is a great starting point, but you should always verify the website manually too.

## Prerequisites

There are multiple helpful tools that can help you to check your website for accessibility issues. Some of them are:

- Lighthouse
  - Chrome - Dev Tools (<kbd>⌥+⌘+I</kbd>) -> `Lighthouse` tab
  - [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/google-lighthouse/)
  - [CLI](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse?tab=readme-ov-file#using-the-node-cli)
- Firefox Accessibility Dev Tools
  - Firefox - Dev Tools (<kbd>⌥+⌘+I</kbd>) -> `Accessibility` tab -> `Check for issues`
- WAVE
  - [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wave-evaluation-tool/jbbplnpkjmmeebjpijfedlgcdilocofh)
  - [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/wave-accessibility-tool/)

## Exercises

### Exercise 1 - Lighthouse (chrome)

1. Open any website you want to test
2. Open Dev Tools (<kbd>⌥+⌘+I</kbd>)
3. Go to `Lighthouse` tab (it may be hidden under `>>`)
4. Select `Normal` mode, one of the device presets and `Accessibility` checkbox
5. Click `Analyze page load`

The tool will analyze and produce a report with the accessibility issues found on the website. It will also provide you with the "accessibility score" and some tips on how to fix the issues.

If there are any issues, you can expand them to see more details along with the DOM element that is causing the issue.

By clicking on `⋮` (three vertical dots), you can export the report to a JSON or PDF file.

### Exercise 2 - Firefox Accessibility Dev Tools

1. Open any website you want to test
2. Open Dev Tools (<kbd>⌥+⌘+I</kbd>)
3. Go to `Accessibility` tab (it may be hidden under `>>`)
4. From the `Check for issues` select, select `All issues`

The tool will analyze and produce a report with the accessibility issues found on the website. If there are any issues, you can expand them to see more details along with the DOM element that is causing the issue.

### Exercise 3 - Wave

1. Open any website you want to test
2. Click on the Wave icon in the browser toolbar or `Right-click` -> `WAVE this page`
3. The tool will analyze and produce a report with the accessibility issues found on the website
4. Go to `Details` tab
5. Unselect everything except `Errors` and `Alerts`
6. Now you can see the issues directly on the website

You will use other options from the tool in the [3.2. Manual testing](3.2-manual-testing.md) part of the kata.
