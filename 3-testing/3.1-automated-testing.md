# 3.1. Automated Accessibility Testing

TODO: Proof read this exercise

In this part of the kata, you'll learn to use tools that run automated accessibility tests on your website. Keep in mind that **automated tools alone cannot ensure full WCAG compliance**. They are a great starting point, but manual verification is always needed.

## Prerequisites

For this exercise, you'll need to install the following tool: **WAVE**.

- [Chrome Add-on](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wave-evaluation-tool/jbbplnpkjmmeebjpijfedlgcdilocofh)
- [Firefox Add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/wave-accessibility-tool/)

Additionally you will use built-in tools in Chrome or Firefox:

- Chrome
  - Lighthouse: Dev Tools (<kbd>⌥+⌘+I</kbd>) -> `Lighthouse` tab
- Firefox
  - Firefox Accessibility Dev Tools: Dev Tools (<kbd>⌥+⌘+I</kbd>) -> `Accessibility` tab -> `Check for issues`

## Exercises

TODO: Add note about doing only one of 1,2 exercises and then 3.

### Exercise 1: Lighthouse (Chrome)

1. Open any website.
2. Open Dev Tools (<kbd>⌥+⌘+I</kbd>).
3. Go to the `Lighthouse` tab (might be hidden under `>>` if not visible).
4. Choose `Navigation (Default)` mode, select a device preset, and check `Accessibility`.
5. Click `Analyze page load`.

Lighthouse will generate a report with an accessibility score, list of issues, and suggestions. Expand any issue for more details, including the problematic DOM elements. You can export the report as a JSON or PDF by clicking the `⋮` menu.

### Exercise 2: Firefox Accessibility Dev Tools

1. Open any website.
2. Open Dev Tools (<kbd>⌥+⌘+I</kbd>).
3. Go to the `Accessibility` tab (might be hidden under `>>` if not visible).
4. Click `Check for issues` and select `All issues`.

This tool will generate a report of any accessibility issues, which you can expand to view more details and corresponding DOM elements.

### Exercise 3: WAVE

1. Open any website.
2. Click the WAVE icon in your browser toolbar or `Right-click` -> `WAVE this page`.
3. WAVE will produce a report highlighting accessibility issues directly on the website.
4. In the `Details` tab, deselect all except `Errors` and `Alerts` to focus on critical issues.

You’ll explore more WAVE options in the next section: [3.2. Manual Testing](3.2-manual-testing.md).
