# 3.1. Automated accessibility testing

In this part of the kata you will learn how to use tools that help you run automated accessibility tests on your website. Remember, that using automated tools **does not guarantee full WACG compliance**. It is a great starting point, but you should always verify the website manually too.

## Prerequisites

There are multiple helpful tools that can help you to check your website for accessibility issues. Some of them are:

- Lighthouse
  - Chrome - Dev Tools (`⌥+⌘+I`) -> `Lighthouse` tab
  - [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/google-lighthouse/)
  - [CLI](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse?tab=readme-ov-file#using-the-node-cli)
- Firefox Accessibility Dev Tools
  - Firefox - Dev Tools (`⌥+⌘+I`) -> `Accessibility` tab -> `Check for issues`
- WAVE
  - [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wave-evaluation-tool/jbbplnpkjmmeebjpijfedlgcdilocofh)
  - [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/wave-accessibility-tool/)
- AXE Dev tools:
  - [Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/axe-devtools-web-accessib/lhdoppojpmngadmnindnejefpokejbdd)
  - [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/axe-devtools/)
- IBM Equal Access Accessibility Checker
  - [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ibm-equal-access-accessib/lkcagbfjnkomcinoddgooolagloogehp)
  - [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/accessibility-checker/)

There are tasks for each of the tools, but you don't need to do them all. Choose the ones that you are most interested in. You can get best outcomes by combining Lighthouse/Firefox Accessibility Dev Tools exercises and one of the other tools.
